# Gravity Challenge

> This repository is for learning purposes. It may intentionally contain bugs or
fail to function properly. The code may be purposefully difficult to read,
contain syntax errors, or only be a partial solution. You should not base code
off of this and absolutely should not use it in production.

Use [known formulas][formulas] to implement a function that calculates how
long it will take an object to fall from a given distance. For instance:

```javascript
var time = fallingTime(20);
```

You can also use [Wolfram Alpha][10meters] to check that you're calculating
the right value.
